# Hyperspectral_Image_Analysis_Spectral_Unmixing_and_Classification
This project focuses on the processing and analysis of Hyperspectral Images (HSIs) using machine learning techniques. It covers spectral unmixing to decompose mixed pixels into pure materials and classification to categorize pixels into known classes, using the Salinas HSI dataset as a case study.
